Technologies used:

Developed with Ruby on Rails 2.3.5, hosted with 2.3.7, 
on Apache with mod_passanger; MySQL used for production db.  Only
track metadata is stored in the database - the actual files are kept on the
OS file system.

Progress monitoring provided by apache-upload-progress-module
(http://github.com/drogus/apache-upload-progress-module)

Progress bar provided by livepipe's Control.ProgressBar.
(http://livepipe.net/control/progressbar)
I had to make some minor modifications to get this to work with the aforementioned
progress module, to show the percentage of upload completion, and to make 
it behave nicer when the upload was finished.

Timestamp-based uuid's generated using the uuidtools gem
(http://rubyforge.org/projects/uuidtools/), 
which implements the RFC4122 spec (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122), and 
hence have only a 1/2^128 chance of colliding.  However, just to be sure,
the controller performs a check against the database.

ID3 tag extraction and editing is done using TagLib 
(http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html)
with ruby bindings from ruby-taglib (http://www.hakubi.us/ruby-taglib/).

MP3 to OGG conversion is done on the command line with mpg321 and oggenc.
